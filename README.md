Hello! 

Where do I begin with this.

On Dec 23, 2021, a YouTuber/Twitch streamer by the name of jschlatt, did a bulk ban of almost every single dream stans on his stream, Live. 

This tool tells if you were part of the purge or not. Simply enter the twitch username to see if that account was a part of that purge or not. 

# Updates

On Apr 25, 2022, there was another purge, which banned some lmanberg flag chatters.
