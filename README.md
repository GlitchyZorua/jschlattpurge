# Was I part of the jschlatt purge?

Hello! 

Where do I begin with this.

On Dec 23, 2021, a YouTuber/Twitch streamer by the name of jschlatt, did a WHOLE bulk ban of almost every single dream stans on his stream, Live. 

This tool tells if you were part of the purge or not. Simply enter your twitch username and... see if you were part of the purge or not.
